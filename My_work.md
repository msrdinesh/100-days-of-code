## Starting this on 6th July 2018

# My previous knowledge before starting this
I have completed the following courses
1. Machine learning(Coursera,Stanford University)
2. Deep learning speacilization(Coursera,Stanford University)
3.Introduction to Python for Data Science(Data Camp)
4. Deep learning in python(Data Camp)

#### Day 1----- Date: July 6, 2018 ------ Day: Friday
##### Intermdiate to Python for Data Science(Data Camp)

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the course "Intermediate to Python for Data Science" which is a sequal of my previous course "introduction to python for data science". I got basic ideas of Dictionaris,pandas,data frames, operators in python through this course. 

**Thoughts:** Its an easy course with very interactive interface, but I have to still be used to coding in python
