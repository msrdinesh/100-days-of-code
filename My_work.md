# 100 Days Of Code 

## Starting this on 6th July 2018

# My previous knowledge before starting this
I have completed the following courses
1. Machine learning(Coursera,Stanford University)
2. Deep learning speacilization(Coursera,Stanford University)
3.Introduction to Python for Data Science(Data Camp)
4. Deep learning in python(Data Camp)

#### Day 1----- Date: July 6, 2018 ------ Day: Friday
##### Intermdiate to Python for Data Science(Data Camp)

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the course "Intermediate to Python for Data Science" which is a sequal of my previous course "introduction to python for data science". I got basic ideas of Dictionaris,pandas,data frames, operators in python through this course. 

**Thoughts:** Its an easy course with very interactive interface, but I have to still be used to coding in python

**Link to work:** This is my statement of accomplishment https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/8e025414725f512e2b0fd5692a1c4d5c18fdaec7

#### Day 2----- Date: July 7, 2018 ------ Day: Saturday
##### Image Depth detection

**Today's Progress**: I did not much work today. I tried figuring out what Mooc to do nex in datacamp. I with one of my friends decided to start a project in deep learning. Looking forward to start it tommorow

**Thoughts:**  The project is to detect depth detection of an image using a famous network architechure called U net. We want to write impletement the project using Keras frame work. We want to run the program in google colab as we dont have a good GPU to run our models

**Link to work:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf Here is the link to U net(Its not my work. My work is just googling Unet and downloading the paper.
