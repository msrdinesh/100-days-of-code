# 100 Days Of Code 

## Starting this on 6th July 2018

# My previous knowledge before starting this
I have completed the following courses
1. Machine learning(Coursera,Stanford University)
2. Deep learning speacilization(Coursera,Stanford University)
3.Introduction to Python for Data Science(Data Camp)
4. Deep learning in python(Data Camp)

#### Day 1----- Date: July 6, 2018 ------ Day: Friday
##### Intermdiate to Python for Data Science(Data Camp)

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the course "Intermediate to Python for Data Science" which is a sequal of my previous course "introduction to python for data science". I got basic ideas of Dictionaris,pandas,data frames, operators in python through this course. 

**Thoughts:** Its an easy course with very interactive interface, but I have to still be used to coding in python

#### Day 2----- Date: July 7, 2018 ------ Day: Saturday
##### Image Depth detection

**Today's Progress**: I did not much work today. I tried figuring out what Mooc to do nex in datacamp. I with one of my friends decided to start a project in deep learning. Looking forward to start it tommorow

**Thoughts:**  The project is to detect depth detection of an image using a famous network architechure called U net. We want to write impletement the project using Keras frame work. We want to run the program in google colab as we dont have a good GPU to run our models

**Link to work:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf Here is the link to U net(Its not my work. My work is just googling Unet and downloading the paper)
#### Day 3----- Date: July 8, 2018 ------ Day: Sunday
##### Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1) Course

**Today's Progress**: I have downloaded some basic must read papers in machine learning and some papers on recent research on image depth measurement. I have doen the course Python Data Science Toolbox(part1) course in datacamp.

**Thoughts:** From the course, I have learnt some basics to write functions in python. Difference between local,global and built in functions in python.dealing with parameters or arguments of funtions, writing nested funtions and error handling funtions. I have learnt quite a lot. But, regarding my reasearch papers stud, I could not read any paper because, I became afraid after seeing a lot of math and complexit involved in the papers. Looking forward to read research paper effecively from tommorow

#### Day 4----- Date: July 9, 2018 ------ Day: Monday
##### Data Science Toolbox (Part 2) Course

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the course Python Data Scinece Toolbox(part2) course in data camp and started the course importing Data in DataCamp

**Thoughts:** From the course, I have learnt about iterators,list and dict comprehensions and genrators. Regarding my project, I am still not confindent to start a project in machine learning.Hope I would figure out soon.
