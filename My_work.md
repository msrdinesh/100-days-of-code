#### Day 1----- Date: July 6, 2018 ------ Day: Friday
##### Intermdiate to Python for Data Science(Data Camp)

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the course "Intermediate to Python for Data Science" which is a sequal of my previous course "introduction to python for data science". I got basic ideas of Dictionaris,pandas,data frames, operators in python through this course. 

**Thoughts:** Its an easy course with very interactive interface, but I have to still be used to coding in python

**Link to work:** This is my statement of accomplishment https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/8e025414725f512e2b0fd5692a1c4d5c18fdaec7

#### Day 2----- Date: July 7, 2018 ------ Day: Saturday
##### Image Depth detection

**Today's Progress**: I did not much work today. I tried figuring out what Mooc to do nex in datacamp. I with one of my friends decided to start a project in deep learning. Looking forward to start it tommorow

**Thoughts:**  The project is to detect depth detection of an image using a famous network architechure called U net. We want to write impletement the project using Keras frame work. We want to run the program in google colab as we dont have a good GPU to run our models

**Link to work:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf Here is the link to U net(Its not my work. My work is just googling Unet and downloading the paper)
#### Day 3----- Date: July 8, 2018 ------ Day: Sunday
##### Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1) Course

**Today's Progress**: I have downloaded some basic must read papers in machine learning and some papers on recent research on image depth measurement. I have doen the course Python Data Science Toolbox(part1) course in datacamp.

**Thoughts:** From the course, I have learnt some basics to write functions in python. Difference between local,global and built in functions in python.dealing with parameters or arguments of funtions, writing nested funtions and error handling funtions. I have learnt quite a lot. But, regarding my reasearch papers stud, I could not read any paper because, I became afraid after seeing a lot of math and complexit involved in the papers. Looking forward to read research paper effecively from tommorow

#### Day 4----- Date: July 9, 2018 ------ Day: Monday
##### Data Science Toolbox (Part 2) Course

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the course Python Data Scinece Toolbox(part2) course in data camp and started the course importing Data in DataCamp

**Thoughts:** From the course, I have learnt about iterators,list and dict comprehensions and genrators. Regarding my project, I am still not confindent to start a project in machine learning.Hope I would figure out soon.

#### Day 5----- Date: July 10, 2018 ------ Day: Tuesday
##### Importing Data in Python(part 1 and 2)

**Today's Progress**: I have succesfully completed the two courses on importing Data with python for data science in python

**Thoughts:** I have learnt how to import flatfiles,textfiles and files of other formats, Writing SQL queries to get meaning ful data from relational databases. In the second part, I have learn pulling data from World wide web using pandas,request packages, pulling data from API's like twitter. It was quite  a  lot this day, hope thes concepts help me improve my career in data science.

#### Day 6----- Date: July 11, 2018 ------ Day: Wednesday
##### Cleaning Data in Python Course

**Today's Progress**: I have successfully completed the course,"Cleaning Data in Python" in data camp.

**Thoughts:** I have learnt some of the preprocessing techniques and packages that are helpfult to clean data before analysis.I have learn about inspecting data,tidying data,concepts of melting and pivoting,combining data sets,testing data for errors. 

**Link to work:** Here is my statement of accomplishment of the course: https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/39984a6342775408ffbc8a659e3ad0a2aed1629e
#### Day 7----- Date: July 12, 2018 ------ Day: Thirsday
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I have not done any course today. Started reading a book called "Machine Learning with ScikiLearn and Tensorflow".

**Thoughts:** The book is  very interesting. It helps to work on hands on projects to gain ecperience. The really love the way the author had conveyed the concepts. I have started first hands on work on book "Housing price dectectio". The whole code is written by author, I am just testing it.

**Link to work:** Heres the link to the book: http://b-ok.xyz/book/2924532/5e9967
#### Day 8----- Date: July 13, 2018 ------ Day: Wednesday
##### Introduction to Git for data science

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the course "Introduction to Git for Data science" in data camp

**Thoughts:** From many days I have been trying to understad github. I am using it with even knowing about it. So I took this introductory course on git. I just got a brief idea of the power of git. I think I can improve if I practise more. Till now I did not even start any project. I am just looking at others codes(which I could hardly understand). I hope I may improve.

#### Day 9----- Date: July 21, 2018 ------ Day: Saturday
##### Datacamp until "merging data with data science

**Today's Progress**: I did not update my work from few days. From now I will try to keep on updating.

**Thoughts:** Ihave done until merging data with python in datacamp, which is the 10 course of 22 courses in the streak. I feel like I am diverting my learning curve away from machine learning, but I will complete this and go back again to machine learning. This may not be right entirely, but I will work hard to learn more

#### Day 10----- Date: July 22, 2018 ------ Day: Monday
##### Introduction to data bases in Python

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the course introduction to data bases in python today

**Thoughts:** I came know how to write queries in SQL. It's boring, but I learned something out of it.

#### Day 11----- Date: July 23, 2018 ------ Day: Tuesday
##### Introduction to data visualizaion with bokeh

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the course on DataCamp.

**Thoughts:** I really got good practce using matplotlib for plotting the graphs to obtain useful insights from data. I cam to know about seaborn a very cool package for statistical data visualisation

**Link to work:** i will stope putting links of certificates

#### Day 30----- Date: Augutst 2, 2018 ------ Day: Thirsday
##### from now on I will update weekly

**From last 15 days Progress**: I stopeed doing the python track from data camp,as it is boring and the concept learned is very less. So, I decided to learn algorithms and datastrutures from now on. Right now I am studying "Automatin the boring stuff with python course" the book is very interesting 

**Thoughts:** I cannot update this daily.. will update weekly once. But every day I am contributing 2-3 hours of time in coding.
